Hi, Iâ€™m Vaibhav Singh, PhD in computational Chemistry in Temple University, Philadelphia, USA. 

Iâ€™m interested in applying data science to research problems such as ultrafast dynamics of gas phase molecules. In my free time, I apply data-science to some of the real-world problems as well. Recently, I have worked on projects such as modeling credit-risk anakysis, categorising fradulent
transactions, analyse sports data etc.

Iâ€™m believe on constant learning and want to keep applying and growing my coding/data-science skills. Currently, apart from working on data-science projects, I am trying to learn quantitative Finance.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on impactful, motivated problems either in Computational Chemistry which requires the knowledge of Quantum Chemistry or even data integrated problems that involves basic understanding of data-science.
To collaborate reach out to me at the email: vaibhav.singh@temple.edu

Also, do not hesitate if wanting to collaborate on playing sports such as Badminton, Cricket, Football ðŸ˜„
